Crowdsale Best Practices "Let The Market Decide"
 
TLDR:
======================
Future crowdsales are adopting the state-of-the-art characteristics of rewarding multiple demographics, a 30 day time window, capped numbers of tokens, and single currency pricing, but are also seeking to improve on this model by letting the market decide the price of their application’s digital tokens during a crowdsale using a sales volume based pricing model.
 
Brief History of Crowdsales
======================

The market serves as the ultimate judge of value and price.
 
With this in mind, let's consider the lessons we can take when it comes to interacting with the market in the realms of selling software, specifically in using the crowdsale model.
 
Recently crowdsales of digital tokens that access software applications have become an increasingly popular option for entrepreneurs and developers to gain users and supporters for their projects.
 
J.R. Willett held one of the first crowdsales in August 2013 when he was developing a protocol for smart property and a decentralized exchange built on top of the Bitcoin Protocol. This project would later be known as the, Metadata Archival by Standard Transaction Embedding Records Protocol or simply the MASTER Protocol AKA Mastercoin.
 
J.R.’s crowdsale went on for a period of 30 days and raised more than 4,700 bitcoins (which were priced at the time around $100 each at the time). 91% of the new digital tokens (MSC) went to the crowdsale participants and 9% went to a core developer pool.
 
This first successful use of the crowdsale model on top of the Bitcoin Protocol attracted many others to emulate it including, Counterparty, ProtoShares, and NXT just to name a few.

Each project has tried a different model of selling digital tokens. For example, Countryparty burned the bitcoin contributions made to their generation address, and ProtoShares held an extended daily auction process for a period of 6 months.
 
The proposed distribution pattern of digital tokens has also moved away from primarily rewarding the crowdsale participants, to that of rewarding multiple demographics such as miners, third party developers, core developers, and others that add value to these applications. This was evident in the MaidSafe crowdsale where the majority (70%) of their tokens will flow to “farmers” that provide storage space to the SAFE Network and then smaller pools of tokens for core developers (10%), and third party developers (10%) and finally the crowdsale participants (10%).
 
MaidSafe was also innovative in being one of the first crowdsales to take multiple crypto currencies including bitcoin and mastercoin. However, it proved difficult to avoid arbitragers seeking to take advantage of either price or liquidity differences between the two currencies.
 
The State of the Art
======================

With this history in mind, we come to the present and the state of the art when it comes to structuring a crowdsale of software for digital tokens. This state of the art can be described broadly as including:
 
1. Rewarding multiple demographics, such as, core developers, third party developers, resource providers, crowdsale participants, and even users who are adding to the network effect of the application.
 
2. Projects are focusing in on the 30-day time window as the best timeframe for holding a crowdsale (as was demonstrated before by Kickstarter).

3. Many projects have opted for a capped number of total digital tokens available in their crowdsale and that will ever exist in their protocol. This is primarily in order to give the participants in the crowdsale the ability to judge the price of what they are purchasing.
 
4. Many projects seem to be opting for accepting a single currency (bitcoin) during the period of their crowdsale in order to avoid issues with arbitrageurs pushing around the prices of the digital tokens involved in the crowdsale. Though it is worth adding that technical solutions for holding multi digital token crowdsales have been proposed for both the Master Protocol and Counterparty, however they have not yet been demonstrated in practice.

Future Models for Crowdsales
======================

Future crowdsales are adopting the state of the art characteristics of rewarding multiple demographics, a 30 day time window, capped numbers of tokens, and single currency pricing, but are also seeking to improve on this model.
 
Two near future examples of this are SWARM (June 17th) & API Network June 18th).

http://www.apinetwork.co/
 
Both projects are rewarding a variety of demographics, have 30-day time windows, have a capped numbers of tokens, and single currency pricing, but both also include a new innovation in the way the price of their tokens is determined. That is, both projects have opted to let the market decide the proper price of their tokens. They are accomplishing this by setting a wide range of prices for their tokens during the crowdsale determined by the volume of bitcoin that is collected.
 
Firstly, for example the API Network is offering API Coins (XAP) at a rate of 1.6 mBTC per XAP for the first 500 bitcoins worth of sales. The price increases to 2.13 mBTC per XAP during the sale of the next 1,000 bitcoins worth of XAP. The price then increases to 2.66 mBTC per XAP during the sale of the next 2,000 bitcoins worth of XAP. Lastly, the price increases to 3.12 mBTC per XAP during the sale of the last 4,692 bitcoins worth of XAP.
 
Secondly, for example with SWARM if you participated in their early part of their crowdsale you would gain 5,250 SWARM coins per bitcoin you send in. This rate of SWARM declines the more bitcoin collected until four thousand BTC are collected and the price increases to 4,250 SWARM per bitcoin. This generation process could continue all the way until twenty one thousand bitcoin are collected and the generation rate falls to 3,750 SWARM per bitcoin.
 
It is worth noting that neither the SWARM team or the API Network team expect to collect the maximum number of bitcoins by selling out all of their tokens (though it is possible if demand has been radically underestimated). Instead, both project have set a range of price points and are leaving it up to the market to decide the proper price of SWARM and API Coins (XAP). If the market decides these projects are highly valued, than the price of the coins will reach a higher level during the crowdsale. Conversely, if the market decides that these projects are not as highly valued, than the price of the coins will not rise as high during the crowdsale. Either way the pricing of these tokens is for the market to determine. 

Specific Best Practices and Disclosures
======================

**Disclosures**

Its worth making disclosures as part of your crowdsale in order to avoid confusion on the part of new users of these technologies or those that might be unfarmilar with crowdsales and what they are buying.

1. Friendly Information: 
The view expressed in these statements and websites (while intended as neutral and informational), should be taken as friendly to the project and its success given it was prepared by those close to the projects development.

2. This Is Not Stock or Equity
Participation in the crowdsale will not provide you with a "security" or "equity" stake in this project. The digital token known as "XYZ" is only useful for accessing the API Network software after its development is complete.

3. No Refunds
No refunds will be made to purchasers of token XYZ, should they change their mind at a later time, as the creation of the XYZ tokens is locked in. Of course, once the purchaser receives his or her tokens after the crowdsale, they are free to send or sell them to anyone of their choice.

4. If You Send BTC From Coinbase or Another Wallet You Don't Have The Private Key Then You Can't Claim Your XYZ Coin
If you send the crowdsale address BTC from a wallet that you do not control the private key for (example Coinbase), then you will not be able to claim the XYZ Coins you purchased and the seller will be unable to generate new ones for you.
